For each pass through the dungeon the character changes but not the world
Information is revealed to both player and character, influencing their decisions

-- JOURNAL --
Facilitates the loop
Moment player picks up journal is benchmark for loop
Contains all of player's spells, portal codes, etc
Everything that persists persists in book
